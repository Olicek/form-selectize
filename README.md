The best way to install olicek/form-selectize is using  [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

$ composer require olicek/form-selectize
```

After installation server site, you have to install client site. 
The best way is use [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=selectize-for-nette).

Link `selectize.js` from **client-side** and original `selectize.js` and call somewhere function `selectize()`.

| NOTE: If you need use previous javascript, it is available in selectize-old.js

Last step is enable the extension using your neon config

```
extensions:
	selectize: Oli\Selectize\SelectizeExtension
```

## Default configuration

```
selectize:
	mode: full # second mode is `select` for selection just 1 option
	create: on
	maxItems: null
	delimiter: #/
	plugins:
		- remove_button
	valueField: id
	labelField: name
	searchField: name
```


## Data in array for full mode

```
array (2)
	0 => array (2)
		id => 1
		name => "First item"
	1 => array (2)
		id => 2
		name => "Second item"
```
id is set as valueField and name as labelField and searchField in config.neon. You can use whatever, have to just set in config.neon or in addSelectize method. For example: 
```
valueField: slug
```

## Data in array for select mode

array (2)
	1 => "First item",
	2 => "Second item"
```

$form->addSelectize('tags', 'štítky', $arrayData);
```

#### custome settings in method first way (array)
```php
$form->addSelectize('tags', 'štítky', $arrayData, ['create' => false, 'maxItems' => 3]);
```

#### custome settings in method first way (method)

```php
$form->addSelectize('tags', 'štítky', $arrayData)->setValueField('slug')->delimiter('_');
